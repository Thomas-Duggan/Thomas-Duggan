# Hello there! Thanks for stopping by.
## About Me:

- My 3D models are created with either **Onshape** or **Tinkercad** (currently learning **AutoCAD** as well).
- I almost exclusively use Linux as my main OS, and primarily have experience with Debian-based distros.
- Everything I create *(except when stated otherwise)* is free to use in anything you want, just credit me!
