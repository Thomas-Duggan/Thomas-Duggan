# Hello there! Thanks for stopping by.
## About Me:
- I am a student of **Memorial University of Newfoundland** since 2023.
- I am experienced in **Python**, **Bash (Unix Shell)**, and **C++**.
- For 3D models, I almost exclusively use **OnShape**, but I am also experienced in **TinkerCAD** and **VRoid Studio**, with plans to learn **AutoCAD** and **Blender**.
- I almost exclusively use **Linux** as my main OS, and primarily have experience with **Debian**-based distributions.
- Everything I create *(except when stated otherwise)* is free to use in anything you want, just credit me!
- I use any pronouns, go wild.
